# Dfs1

A dfs1 file contains node-based line series data. Dfs1 files do not contain enough metadata to determine their geographical position, but have a relative distance from the origo. 


```{python}
import mikeio
ds = mikeio.read("data/tide1.dfs1")
ds
```

## Grid 1D

The spatial information is available in the `geometry` attribute (accessible from Dfs1, Dataset, and DataArray), which in the case of a dfs1 file is a [`Grid1D`](`mikeio.Grid1D`) geometry. 

```{python}
ds.geometry
```

Grid1D's primary properties and methods are: 

* `x` 
* `nx`
* `dx`
* `find_index()`
* `isel()`

See [API specification](`mikeio.Grid1D`) for details.
