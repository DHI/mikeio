title: Dfs0 - Relative time axis
jupyter: python3
---


MIKE IO uses a pandas DatetimeIndex to represent the time dimension in dfs files. If the dfs file has a relative time axis, it will be represented as a pandas TimedeltaIndex.

```{python}
import mikeio
```

```{python}
ds = mikeio.read("../../data/eq_relative.dfs0")
ds
```

```{python}
ds.time[:5]
```

```{python}
df = ds.to_dataframe()
df.head()
```

```{python}
df['Item 5'].plot();
```

## mikecore

An alternative is to use the underlying library [`mikecore`](https://github.com/DHI/mikecore-python) to read the file.

```{python}
from mikecore.DfsFileFactory import DfsFileFactory

dfs = DfsFileFactory.DfsGenericOpen("../../data/eq_relative.dfs0")
```

Using the `ReadDfs0DataDouble` method you get the data as a numpy array, with the time axis or other type of as the first column,

```{python}
data = dfs.ReadDfs0DataDouble()

type(data)
```

which can be converted to a pandas dataframe. First we extract the name of items (which in this example hapeens to be not very creative).

```{python}
index_name = "time"
items = [i.Name for i in dfs.ItemInfo]
items = [index_name] + items
items
```

```{python}
import pandas as df

df = df.DataFrame(data, columns=items).set_index(index_name)
df.head()
```
