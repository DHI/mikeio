title: Dfs0 - CMEMS *in-situ* data
jupyter: python3
---



```{python}
import pandas as pd
import xarray as xr
import mikeio
```

```{python}
fino = xr.open_dataset("../../data/NO_TS_MO_FINO1_202209.nc")
fino
```

CMEMS *in-situ* data is provided in a standardised format, the [OceanSITES time-series data format](http://www.oceansites.org/docs/oceansites_data_format_reference_manual.pdf).

> "*The OceanSITES programme is the global network of open-ocean sustained time series 
sites, called ocean reference stations, being implemented by an international partnership of 
researchers and agencies. OceanSITES provides fixed-point time series of various physical, 
biogeochemical, ecosystem and atmospheric variables at locations around the globe, from 
the atmosphere and sea surface to the seafloor. The programâ€™s objective is to build and 
maintain a multidisciplinary global network for a broad range of research and operational 
applications including climate, carbon, and ecosystem variability and forecasting and ocean 
state validation*"

Find out which variables we are interested in to extract:

```{python}
data = [
    {
        "name": fino[var].name,
        "standard_name": fino[var].standard_name,
        "units": fino[var].units,
    }
    for var in fino.data_vars
    if hasattr(fino[var], "units")
]

pd.DataFrame(data)
```

The data have a DEPTH dimension, even though variables are only measured at a single level and doesn't vary in time although the format allows for it.

I.e. temperature (TEMP) is available at level 1 (0.5 m)

```{python}
fino.DEPH.plot.line(x="TIME")
```

```{python}
fino['TEMP'].plot.line("-^",x='TIME')
```

```{python}
fino['VHM0'].plot.line("-^",x='TIME')
```

Wave data are only available at the surface.

```{python}
fino[['VHM0','VTZA','VPED']].isel(DEPTH=0)
```

```{python}
df = fino[['VHM0','VTZA','VPED']].isel(DEPTH=0).to_dataframe()
```

The data are stored on the concurrent timesteps.

```{python}
df[['VHM0','VTZA','VPED']].head()
```

```{python}
df[['VHM0','VTZA']].plot(style='+')
```

Convert the wave height data to a mikeio dataset.

```{python}
ds = mikeio.from_pandas(
    df[["VHM0"]].dropna(), items=mikeio.ItemInfo(mikeio.EUMType.Significant_wave_height)
)
ds
```

Store the results in Dfs0 format.

```{python}
ds.to_dfs("FINO1_VHM0.dfs0")
```

Read the file again to check...

```{python}
ds = mikeio.read("FINO1_VHM0.dfs0")
ds
```
