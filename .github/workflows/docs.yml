# Documentation is published ONLY when a new release is published on GitHub.
# This ensures that the published documentation always matches the version
# available on PyPI, preventing confusion from documenting unreleased features.
#
# To publish documentation:
# 1. Create a new release on GitHub (this will also publish to PyPI via python-publish.yml)
# 2. This workflow will automatically build and deploy the docs to GitHub Pages
#
# To test documentation locally before release:
#   make docs
#   open docs/_site/index.html
